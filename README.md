### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

For Back-End dependencies, go to `server` folder inside the project and run the command:

### `yarn install`

For Front-End dependencies, from the app root folder run the command:

### `yarn install`

To run the app, you can execute this command from the root folder. Both Back-End and Fron-End will run together

### `yarn run dev`

Server will be running in [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000)

And client app will open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
